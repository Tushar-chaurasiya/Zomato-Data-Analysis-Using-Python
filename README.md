Zomato Data Analysis Project
----------------------------------

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the Zomato dataset to gain insights into restaurant trends, customer preferences, and key performance indicators. The goal is to uncover patterns and provide actionable insights through data analysis and visualization.

Objectives :-

* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset.
* Visualize key insights related to restaurant locations, ratings, cuisines, and pricing.
* Analyze trends in customer reviews, top cuisines, and restaurant distribution across different cities.
* Develop recommendations based on findings.

Dataset :-

The dataset used for this project contains 51,717 rows and 17 columns. It includes information on restaurants such as:

* Restaurant Name
* Location
* Cuisine Type
* Ratings
* Cost for two people
* Number of votes

Key Features :-

* Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and data type conversions.
* Data Visualization: Insights are visualized using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.
* Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant information from raw data.
* Geographical Analysis: Analyzing restaurant locations across cities.
* Rating Analysis: Examining patterns in customer ratings and reviews.

Tools and Technologies :-

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

Steps Involved -

1. Data Loading and Cleaning:-

  * Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
  * Addressed missing data and handled outliers.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):-

  * Analyzed distributions, correlations, and patterns in the data.
  * Visualized the relationship between ratings, cuisines, and pricing.

3. Data Visualization :-

  * Used matplotlib and seaborn to create bar charts, heatmaps, and pie charts.
  * Geographical analysis of restaurant distribution.

4. Conclusion and Insights :-

  * Summarized findings, such as popular cuisines, high-rated restaurants, and cost-effectiveness across different regions.
  * Provided actionable insights for Zomato's market strategies.

Results :-

* Top-rated Restaurants: Analysis of the highest-rated restaurants and their characteristics.
* Popular Cuisines: Insights into the most preferred cuisines across different cities.
* Cost vs. Rating: Relationship between restaurant ratings and pricing.
* City-wise Restaurant Distribution: Geographical trends in restaurant availability.
